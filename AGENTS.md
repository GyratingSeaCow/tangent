# AGENTS.md

This file tells AI coding agents (and humans) how to work on ADH2.

## Project summary

ADH2 is a self-hosted, offline-first voice brain-dump app built for ADHD brains. Flutter client (Android/Linux/Windows) + Python server (FastAPI + Whisper-large-v3). AGPL-3.0.

See [`README.md`](./README.md) for the public-facing overview.

## Working in this repo

### Do

- Read `README.md` and the relevant source before writing any code
- Follow the AGPL-3.0 license header convention (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE))
- Use Flutter conventions for the client (`client/`), Python/FastAPI for the server (`server/`)
- Commit small, atomic changes with clear messages
- Update the design spec when reality diverges from the plan

### Don't

- Don't add features not in the v1 spec without updating the spec first
- Don't commit `*.bin`, `*.gguf`, audio recordings, or anything under `data/` — see `.gitignore`
- Don't add cloud-only features without an offline-first equivalent
- Don't break the AGPL by adding closed-source dependencies

## Status

Shipping — **v1.3.0** (see CHANGELOG.md). Client and server are both implemented and tested (1320 Flutter tests, 162 server tests, 100 Kotlin tests). Current work state and open defects live in `docs/HANDOFF-2026-09-19.md`.
